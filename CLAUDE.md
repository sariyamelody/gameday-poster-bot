# Claude AI Assistant Context & Notes

This document contains context, insights, and recommendations from Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) for the Seattle Mariners Gameday Telegram Bot project.

## Project Genesis

**Initial Request**: "Think hard and write a plan for a Telegram bot that finds the Seattle Mariners game schedule (on startup), and posts a link to the MLB Gameday for the day's game 5 minutes before the game starts."

**Approach Taken**: Comprehensive staff-level engineering plan with production-ready architecture, not just a simple script.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Architecture Choice: Event-Driven with Scheduled Tasks

**Rationale**: Rather than a polling-based system that continuously checks for games, we chose an event-driven architecture where:
- Schedule is fetched once daily (or on startup)
- Individual notification jobs are scheduled for each game
- System remains idle between scheduled events, saving resources

**Alternative Considered**: Continuous polling every few minutes
**Why Rejected**: Resource inefficient, unnecessary API calls, more complex state management

### 2. Database Choice: SQLite

**Rationale**: 
- Perfect for single-server deployment
- Zero configuration overhead
- ACID compliance for reliable data consistency
- Built-in Python support
- Easy backup and migration

**Alternative Considered**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
**Why Rejected**: Overkill for this scale, additional operational complexity

### 3. Scheduling Library: APScheduler

**Rationale**:
- Production-ready with persistent job storage
- Timezone-aware scheduling (critical for sports)
- Graceful handling of system restarts
- Built-in job conflict resolution

**Alternative Considered**: Custom cron-based solution
**Why Rejected**: Would require reimplementing timezone handling, persistence, and error recovery

### 4. Package Manager: uv

**Rationale**:
- **Extremely fast**: 10-100x faster than pip/poetry for dependency resolution
- **Single binary**: No separate virtual environment management needed
- **Modern standards**: Full PEP 621 support with pyproject.toml
- **Lock file support**: Reproducible builds with uv.lock
- **Drop-in replacement**: Works with existing Python tooling

**Alternative Considered**: Poetry
**Why Rejected**: Slower dependency resolution, more complex virtual environment handling

### 5. Container Registry: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

**Rationale**:
- Free for public repositories
- Seamless GitHub Actions integration
- Automatic vulnerability scanning
- Multi-architecture support (AMD64/ARM64)

**Alternative Considered**: Docker Hub
**Why Rejected**: Less integrated with GitHub ecosystem, rate limiting concerns

## Technical Insights

### Timezone Complexity
Sports scheduling involves complex timezone considerations:
- **Game times** are published in local venue timezone
- **Notifications** need to account for daylight saving transitions
- **Storage strategy**: All times stored in UTC, converted for display
- **Edge case**: Games spanning DST transition dates

### MLB API Research Findings

**Primary API**: MLB Stats API (`statsapi.mlb.com`)
- **Seattle Mariners Team ID**: 136
- **Reliability**: Official MLB data source
- **Rate limits**: Reasonable for personal use
- **Data quality**: Comprehensive game metadata including gamePk identifiers

**Alternative APIs Researched**:
- `mlbcal` package: Good for CSV exports but less real-time
- SportsBlaze API: Commercial, potentially more expensive

### Telegram Bot Architecture Insights

**Library Choice**: `python-telegram-bot` v20+
- **Async/await support**: Better resource utilization
- **Built-in error handling**: Automatic retry logic
- **Webhook vs Polling**: Polling chosen for simplicity in personal deployment

**Message Design Philosophy**:
- **Rich formatting**: Emojis and structured layout for readability
- **Actionable links**: Direct link to MLB Gameday for immediate engagement
- **Context-aware**: Include opponent, venue, and local time information

## Security & Reliability Considerations

### Error Handling Strategy
Multi-layered approach:
1. **API Level**: Exponential backoff with circuit breaker
2. **Network Level**: Retry logic with jitter
3. **Application Level**: Dead letter queue for failed notifications
4. **System Level**: Health checks and graceful degradation

### Container Security
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice
- **Multi-stage builds**: Minimal attack surface
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Automated with Trivy
- **Dependency scanning**: Bandit and Safety in CI pipeline

## Development Workflow Insights

### CI/CD Pipeline Design
**Multi-stage approach** (Successfully Implemented):
1. **Test stage**: Unit tests, linting, type checking with uv
2. **Security stage**: Bandit security scanning, vulnerability analysis
3. **Build stage**: Multi-architecture Docker builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) with GitHub Actions caching
4. **Deploy stage**: Automated deployment triggers with GitHub Container Registry

**Key insights**: 
- Parallel job execution in early stages for faster feedback (implemented)
- Sequential stages for safety with proper dependencies
- uv reduces CI build times by 5-10x compared to pip/poetry
- GitHub Container Registry provides seamless integration with zero-config secrets
- Multi-architecture builds enable deployment on diverse infrastructure

### Monitoring Strategy
**OpenTelemetry-based observability**:
- **Logs**: Structured JSON with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: OpenTelemetry metrics with multiple export options
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- **Health checks**: Both application and infrastructure level

**Key insight**: OpenTelemetry provides vendor-neutral observability with flexibility to export to multiple backends (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana Cloud, Honeycomb, etc.)

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Limits
- **Single server deployment**: Suitable for personal use
- **SQLite database**: Handles thousands of concurrent users
- **APScheduler**: Scales to hundreds of scheduled jobs

### Future Scaling Options
If growth exceeds single-server capacity:
1. **Database**: Migrate to PostgreSQL with minimal code changes
2. **Scheduling**: Move to Redis-backed job queue (Celery/RQ)
3. **Deployment**: Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling
4. **Caching**: Add Redis for API response caching

## Operational Insights

### Deployment Recommendations
**Infrastructure sizing**:
- **Minimum viable**: 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU (for development)
- **Production recommended**: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU (handles growth)
- **Storage**: 20GB (logs, database, container images)

**Hosting options ranked**:
1. **Self-hosted VPS**: Maximum control, lowest cost
2. **Railway/Render**: Easy deployment, good free tiers
3. **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless benefits, pay-per-use
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Balanced approach

### Monitoring Recommendations
**Essential metrics to track**:
- Notification delivery success rate
- API response times and error rates  
- Database query performance
- Scheduled job execution lag
- Memory and CPU utilization

**Tracing benefits**:
- End-to-end request visibility

## New Features Implementation Guide

### Recent Feature Additions (2025-09)

#### 1. Live Game Detection (`/nextgame` Enhancement)
**Location**: `mariners_bot/database/repository.py` - `get_current_games()` method
```python
async def get_current_games(self, within_hours: int = 2) -> list[Game]:
    """Get games currently in progress (started within specified hours)."""
```
**Usage**: Automatically detects if a Mariners game is currently running and includes it in `/nextgame` responses.

#### 2. Pitching Matchup Integration
**Location**: `mariners_bot/clients/mlb_client.py` - `get_probable_pitchers()` method
```python
async def get_probable_pitchers(self, game_id: str) -> dict[str, str] | None:
    """Get probable pitchers for a specific game using MLB API hydration."""
```
**Integration Points**:
- Game notifications (`mariners_bot/scheduler/game_scheduler.py`)
- `/nextgame` command responses (`mariners_bot/bot/telegram_bot.py`)

#### 3. Baseball Savant Analytics Links
**Location**: `mariners_bot/models/game.py` - `baseball_savant_url` property
```python
@property
def baseball_savant_url(self) -> str:
    """Generate Baseball Savant Gamefeed URL using game ID."""
    return f"https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/gamefeed?gamePk={self.game_id}"
```

#### 4. Message Filtering Enhancement
**Location**: `mariners_bot/bot/telegram_bot.py` - `_setup_handlers()` method
```python
# Only respond to messages in private chats, ignore channel messages unless commands
MessageHandler(filters.TEXT & ~filters.COMMAND & filters.ChatType.PRIVATE, self._handle_message)
```

### Critical Implementation Patterns

#### Error Handling Strategy
All new features implement comprehensive error handling:
```python
try:
    # Feature implementation
    async with MLBClient(self.settings) as mlb_client:
        result = await mlb_client.get_probable_pitchers(game_id)
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning("Failed to get feature data", game_id=game_id, error=str(e))
    # Graceful degradation - feature fails silently, core functionality continues
```

#### Async/Await Patterns
**Critical**: All new methods must be async-compatible:
- Database operations: `await repository.get_current_games()`
- API calls: `async with MLBClient() as client:`
- Scheduler callbacks: Global wrapper functions to avoid serialization issues

#### Type Safety
**Requirement**: All new code must pass mypy type checking:
```python
from typing import Any
# Explicit type annotations for all parameters and return values
async def new_feature(self, param: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
```

### Docker & Deployment Notes

#### Container Architecture
**Current**: Single-stage build for simplicity
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
# Install uv, copy code, sync dependencies
# Run as non-root user (appuser:1000:1000)
CMD ["mariners-bot", "start"]
```

**Volume Permissions**: Host user should have UID:GID 1000:1000 for data persistence

#### CI/CD Pipeline Status
**All checks passing**:
- ✅ Security scanning (Bandit)
- ✅ Unit tests (pytest)
- ✅ Type checking (mypy)
- ✅ Linting (ruff)
- ✅ Container build & push
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning (Trivy)

### Known Issues & Solutions

#### APScheduler Serialization
**Problem**: Instance methods cannot be serialized as job callbacks
**Solution**: Use global wrapper functions in `game_scheduler.py`:
```python
_notification_callback: Callable[[NotificationJob], Awaitable[bool]] | None = None

async def _notification_wrapper(notification_job: NotificationJob) -> None:
    if _notification_callback:
        await _notification_callback(notification_job)
```

#### Timezone Handling
**Critical**: All datetime operations must use Pacific Time for game scheduling
```python
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
pt_timezone = ZoneInfo("America/Los_Angeles")
now_pt = datetime.now(pt_timezone)
```

#### OpenTelemetry Metrics
**Issue Resolved**: Metric readers must be passed to MeterProvider constructor
```python
metric_readers = _setup_metric_readers(settings)
metric_provider = MeterProvider(resource=resource, metric_readers=metric_readers)
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Coverage Requirements
- **Unit tests**: All business logic methods
- **Integration tests**: API client interactions
- **Type checking**: mypy compliance required
- **Security scanning**: No high-severity issues

#### Test Environment Setup
```bash
uv sync --extra dev  # Install test dependencies
uv run pytest tests/  # Run test suite
uv run mypy mariners_bot/  # Type checking
uv run ruff check --fix .  # Linting with auto-fix
```

### Future Development Guidelines

#### Adding New Features
1. **Database changes**: Create Alembic migration
2. **API integration**: Add to `mlb_client.py` with async/await
3. **Bot commands**: Add to `telegram_bot.py` with proper error handling
4. **Scheduling**: Use global callback pattern in `game_scheduler.py`
5. **Testing**: Add unit tests, update type annotations
6. **CI/CD**: Ensure all pipeline checks pass

#### Code Quality Standards
- **Type safety**: All new code must pass `mypy` checks
- **Security**: Run `bandit` scan, fix high-severity issues
- **Performance**: Use async patterns, avoid blocking operations
- **Observability**: Add structured logging with OpenTelemetry
- **Documentation**: Update docstrings, add inline comments for complex logic

This implementation demonstrates engineering rigor appropriate for production use while maintaining the simplicity needed for personal deployment. The architecture has successfully scaled to support advanced features while preserving the core reliability and performance characteristics.
